###Calculate producer's network metrics


# use ggplot for making heat maps #could also check the heatmap2 package

# want to see if mem, att, pref have an effect on producer's centrality using network metrics from pre-forage phase as a reference point/baseline
# calculate differences between producer's network metrics between phases for each combo of mem/att/pref and 
# make a heat map for mem x att (use only differences for preference = 0, or average over all preference values IF there are little differences between attxmem heatmaps across preference values), mem x pref, att x pref where red shows the biggest differences
